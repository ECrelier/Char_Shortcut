# SillyTavern Character Shortcut Extension

This extension adds a convenient character shortcut bar to SillyTavern's chat interface just above the chat input, allowing you to quickly select and speak as any group member with a single click. It streamlines roleplay and multi-character conversations by making character switching fast and visual.

## Features

- **Quick Character Selection:** Instantly speak as any group member by clicking their avatar in the shortcut bar above the chat input.
- **Favorites Highlighted:** Favorite characters are visually marked for easy access.
- **Automatic Updates:** The shortcut bar updates in real-time as group members are added or removed.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works directly with SillyTavern's group chat UI, requiring no extra configuration, keeping the defaul behavior.
